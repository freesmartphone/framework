DTest
-----
DTest is a framework to test the high level DBus API of FSO. It uses gabriel to
connect to the mobile device and control/query the DBus API. DTest can also use
two different FSO devices to test usage scenarios that need the control of both
ends.

Requirements
------------
 * gabriel on the testing machine
 * socat on the FSO device(s)

Usage
-----
Just run
./dtest -p <IP of primary FSO device> [-s <IP of secondary FSO device>]
and all tests in tests/ will be run. If you only want to run tests found in
certain files you need to add the files with the -t option ( -t sample will
only run tests found in tests/sample.py).

Testing
-------
To add your own test cases just add a file in tests/ and subclass
fsotest.FSOTestCase.
This class gives you access to the different DBus busses and will provide some
more convenience functions like DBus interface and object caches.
