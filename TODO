== controller / general ==
* get rid of self.interface in every dbus object and solely rely on introspection
  Benefits: 1.) get rid of double bookkeeping 2.) one object can serve multiple interfaces anyways
* introduce dbus subsystem or dbus object inter-dependencies and honor the dependency graph on startup

== odeviced ==
* enhance main module interface for simple introspection
* add device specific modules
* how to deal with granularity?
* how to handle priorities, e.g. when a device specific module would
  offer the same object/interface as a generic module?

* get more characteristics from the Display object

General Question:
* How much can or should we rely on ophoned being the only one talking to the modem?
  If so, we can simplify a lot on keeping internal state instead of
  poking the modem every time.

GSM 07.07 / 07.05 Observations and/or Questions:
* On channel init, we better send \x1a first -- just in case something crashed while we
  were inside a multiline request command
* +CFUN=1 resets previous +CPIN="abcd" (even with 2nd parameter?)
* +CFUN=1 always "succeeds" even if it answers with ERROR (SIM PIN Required)
* I always receive CME ERROR 32 on +COPS=? until CREG=1
* +CREG=%d influences both the unsolicited response as well as the solicited response code
* Phonebook indices start with 1 (not 0)
* If SIM PIN not given, SIM file reading commands (phonebook, messagebook, crm) deliver the slightly misleading
  CMS error code 310 (=SIM NOT INSERTED)
* If SMS phone number available in messagebook, address name will be automatically inserted
* +CNUM usually returns CME error 22 (=NOT FOUND), but real output can look like:
  +CNUM: ,"0775753xxxxx",129 or +CNUM: "LINE 1",+xxyyzz",145
* If SIM Pin not given, +CNMI fails
* Homezone:

REAL TODOS:
* add CCLD inspection for generic modem call handling
* make dbus_object a singleton
* multipart SMSes (SMS PDU mode)
* USSD
* Cell Broadcasts
* Call multiparty handling
* Call deflection et. al.
* COLP=1

== opreferencesd ==

* Add support for tree keys (like : foo/spam)
* Add support for dictionaries
* in the test dir, add a profile configuration file, that defines the possible profiles
