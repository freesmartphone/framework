General Question:
* How much can we rely on ophoned being the only one talking to the modem?
  If so, we can simplify a lot on keeping internal state instead of
  poking the modem every time.

GSM 07.07 / 07.05 Observations and/or Questions:
* On channel init, you better send \x1a first -- just in case something crashed while we
  were inside a multiline request command
* +CFUN=1 resets previous +CPIN="abcd"
* +CFUN=1 always succeeds even if it answers with ERROR (SIM PIN Required)
* I always receive CME ERROR 32 on +COPS=? until CREG=1
* +CREG=%d influences both the unsolicited response as well as the solicited response code
* Phonebook indices start with 1 (not 0)
* If SIM PIN not given, SIM messagebook requests the slightly misleading 
  CMS error code 310 (=SIM NOT INSERTED)
* If SMS phone number available in messagebook, address name will be automatically inserted
