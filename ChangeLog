2009-01-02	Michael Lauer	<mlauer@vanille-media.de>

	* Removed ListObjectsByInterface from frameworkd objectquery.py. This will
	  now be implemented by dbus-hlid (a seperate FSO project).
	* [oeventsd] Added OccupyResource action and add some convenient rules.

2008-12-30	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [odeviced] Register objects under /org/freesmartphone/Device/Display/ also
	  with an numerical incremental alias -- e.g. the first display can now 
	  also be accessed via /org/freesmartphone/Device/Display/0.
	* [rules] Adjust the default backlight brightness rule to use display "0".

2008-12-29	Michael lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* Support external subsystems. If you add a section with an 'external' attribute, then
	the section will be treated as an external subsystem to launch with the path given as an attribute:
	[mysubsystem]
	external=/foo/bar
	TODO: Add 'relaunch' attribute.
	NOTE: This is the first step towards integrating Vala/C subsystems to frameworkd.
	NOTE2: You can also "override" internal subsystems by giving the 'external' attribute.

2008-12-27	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Refactored Modem.dataOptions() into "pppd-configuration" attribute in modem data storage.
	* [ogsmd] Added TI-Calypso specific configuration option "ti_calypso_dsp_mode" to configure
	  audio enhancements. Documentation for this option has been added to the sample configuration file.

2008-12-24	Daniel Willmann	<daniel@totalueberwachung.de>

	* [ogsmd] Added network access type to Provider Info (WARNING, breaks API!)
	* [ogsmd] Support for Ericsson F3507g modem (as found in Thinkpads)
	* [ogsmd] Preliminary support for Option UMTS cards

2008-12-20	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Create qualcomm_msm modem abstraction based on singleline with minimal changes.

2008-12-18	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ousaged] Check resume reason and launch emergency shutdown, if we
	  woke up due to low battery. NOTE: This is only supported on Openmoko
	  devices now. As there is no standard infrastructure for that in the
	  kernel, we have to deal with device-specific solutions in lowlevel.py

2008-12-17	Jan Luebbe      <jluebbe@debian.org>

	* [otimed] Add simple timesync to NTP and GPS

2008-12-12	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.Phone.[Start|Stop]AutoRegister()
	  and its signal org.freesmartphone.GSM.Phone.ServiceStatus()
	  This is a convenient way to ensure that ogsmd always tries to unlock the SIM
	  and register with a provider, if necessary.
	  (Corresponding functionality for Gprs is under discussion).

2008-12-11	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.NetworkStatus()
	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.GetNetworkStatus()
	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network.TimeZoneReport()
	* [ogsmd] Refactored PDP handling for more stability

2008-12-06	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Added 'cid' and 'lac' results to org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network.GetStatus()
	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.SIM.GetIssuer()
	  NOTE: Clients can now show the Mobile Virtual Network Operator instead of the
	  actual service provider, if they want to. See e.g. FSO ticket #271.
	* [ogsmd] Added codeToOperator function and a mobile network operator database
	* [ogsmd] [FREESCALE NEPTUNE] Query our MNO database to show the alphanumeric operator name.

2008-12-05	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [odeviced] Implemented org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetNetworking(s,s) -> ()

2008-12-04	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* Added necessary methods for a clean system -> subsystems -> objects shutdown.
	* [ousaged] Disabled resource on shutdown.
	* [ogsmd] Implemented org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.[Get|Set]MicrophoneMuted

2008-12-02	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [onetworkd] Simple connection sharing now works. See
	  org.freesmartphone.Network.StartConnectionSharingWithInterface(s) -> ()
	  This fixes FSO ticket #244.
	* [odeviced] Added two new resources: 'CPU' and 'Display':
	  Requesting the CPU resource will prevent the idle notifier from falling
	  into the 'suspend' state, requesting the Display resource will prevent
	  the idle notifier from falling into the 'idle_dim' (and following) state(s).
	  With these two resource, it now takes only one additional rule to prevent
	  the system from suspending while on a call or a musicplayer is playing.
	* [ousaged] org.freesmartphone.Usage.Suspend() now returns a value instead
	  of timing out (call did not return before the actual suspend was triggered).
	  As an inherent result, the suspend now occurs asynchronous.
	  This fixes FSO ticket #215.
	* [ousaged] Added org.freesmartphone.Usage.[Shutdown|Reboot]() -> ()
	* [ousaged] Send signal org.freesmartphone.Usage.SystemAction()
	  before suspending, after resuming, before shutting down, before rebooting.
	  This fixes FSO ticket #287.

2008-12-01	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Implement org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.[Get|Set]SpeakerVolume

2008-11-30	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Start with CINTERION MC75 support

2008-11-28	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Revamped callhandling. Refactored the state-based call handler
	  from TI Calypso (and Freescale Neptune) into a generic class that will
	  be used from all modem abstractions. Ported singleline to use the new
	  call handler. More tests needed for TI Calypso and Freescale Neptune.

2008-11-27	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [tests] Started with dbus API tests

2008-11-23	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Added reinit method to abstract modem class,
	   added hook for handling a HUP in the low level channel class,
	   added reinitializing the TI Calypso modem class whenever
	   a HUP on any MUXer channel has been detected (which means
	   that the gsm0710muxd has probably been killed).
	   NOTE: We now survive a killall gsm0710muxd transparently!

2008-11-21	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [odeviced] Fixed a couple of problems in the Audio problem and support new features
	  such as a loop parameter and an optional length override (time in seconds).
	  NOTE: Some codecs (i.e. machine emulators such as siddec) can not find out
	  when a song ends, hence it will play forever until you stop it (or give
	  it a length override, which is now possible).
	  WARNING: API breakage in org.freesmartphone.Device.Audio.PlaySound()
	* [oeventsd]: catch up with API breakage in odeviced/audio
	* [rules]: override length for SID ring and message tunes
	  This fixes FSO ticket #247 and the message notification tone only working
	  for the first time in ms4(.1)

2008-11-19	Tobias Gruetzmacher	<tobias-lists@23.gs>

	* Support audio file options in org.freesmartphone.Device.Audio

2008-11-14	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* Implement org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network.GetCountryCode() -> ss
	* [odeviced] Added kernel26 option called 'fb_blank' (default=1).
	  If you suffer from the Om bug WSOD (white screen of death), try
	  setting this option to 0.

2008-11-02	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* python-hotshot is deprecated and give bogus results. Switch to cProfile and
	  import http://www.gnome.org/~johan/lsprofcalltree.py, that way we can view
	  the profile results in kcachegrind.

2008-11-01	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* Add command line argument for profiling with the python-hotshot profiler

2008-10-31	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Added TI-Calypso specific modem option called 'ti_calypso_deep_sleep'.
	  Valid values are: 'never', 'adaptive' (default), and 'always'. See Om bug #1024.
	* [ogsmd] Fixed bogus logic and sent-on-wrong-channel bugs in
	  org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network.SetCallingIdentification.

2008-10-29	Jan Luebbe      <jluebbe@debian.org>

	* [oeventsd] Handled suspending after pressing the powerbutton in the rules

2008-10-26	Michael Lauer	<mickey@openmoko.org>

	* [ogsmd] Fully implemented the Resource interface.
	  You can now open/close this an unlimited number of times.
	  (Note the FIXME though, there's a race condition still.)
	* [ogsmd] Supress org.freesmartphone.GSM.SIM.NotFound as
	  a possible response to org.freesmartphone.GSM.SIM.RetrieveMessagebook,
	  instead send an empty list.

2008-09-29	Jan Luebbe      <jluebbe@debian.org>

	* [ousaged] When a new Resource becomes available, the ResourceAvailable
	  signal is sent.

2008-09-29	Daniel Willmann	<daniel@totalueberwachung.de>
