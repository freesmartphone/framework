== Motorola EZX modem specific notes ==

=== Behaviour ===

* +CFUN=0;+CFUN=1 does _not_ reset the PIN lock

* Giving a valid PIN to unlock starts autoregister
  (likewise, for an unlocked SIM +CFUN=1 will autoregister)

* Unregistering is generally frowned upon -- if you query the operator too early after unregistering, you'll get garbage:
  2008.07.02 22:19:38 ogsmd    DEBUG    <MiscChannel via /dev/mux6>: got 31 bytes from: '\r\n+COPS: 0,2,"\x10*Zd\x12\x04I\xdc"\r\n\r\nOK\r\n'      
  Without antenna off/on, it doesn't seem to be possible to reregister again

=== GSM standards violations ===

* +CPIN: PIN entry is +CPIN=%d,"%s". %d being 1 for PIN1

* +CRC: Incoming call alert always RING: %d. +CRC setting is not honored.

* +CGML: format violation, missing a ',' (PDU header)

* +CGMR: format violation, missing a ',' (PDU header)

* +CSCB: format violation, not accepting any parameters but '0' (all) and '1' (none)
