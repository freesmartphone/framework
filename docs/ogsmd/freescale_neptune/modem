== Motorola EZX modem specific notes ==

=== Behaviour ===

* +CFUN=0;+CFUN=1 does _not_ reset the PIN lock; sending these commands too often / too fast confuses the 
modem.

* Giving a valid PIN to unlock starts autoregister
  (likewise, for an unlocked SIM +CFUN=1 will autoregister)
  
* Modem needs +EPMS? and +EGML=4 before +CGML (and friends) will work. Said commands will only work once after BP initialization though.
  Afterwards they will return +CMS ERROR 500 (unknown error).

* Unregistering is generally frowned upon -- if you query the operator too early after unregistering, you'll get garbage:
  2008.07.02 22:19:38 ogsmd    DEBUG    <MiscChannel via /dev/mux6>: got 31 bytes from: '\r\n+COPS: 0,2,"\x10*Zd\x12\x04I\xdc"\r\n\r\nOK\r\n'      
  Without antenna off/on, it doesn't seem to be possible to reregister again

* After +CFUN=1 (previously +CFUN=0), the modem sends quite a bunch of URCs, e.g. +CMSM: 3 and +EMSR: 0, 
+EFLEX, and much more.

* To enable USB charging, you need to issue +USBSTAT=255,1

=== GSM standards violations ===

* Phonenumber format needs '+' in addition to ntype = 145

* +CPIN: PIN entry is +CPIN=%d,"%s". %d being 1 for PIN1

* +CRC: Incoming call alert always RING: %d. +CRC setting is not honored.

* +CMGL: format violation, missing a ',' (PDU header)

* +CMGR: format violation, missing a ',' (PDU header)

* +CSCB: format violation, not accepting any parameters but '0' (all) and '1' (none)

* +CMT: format violation, missing a ',' (PDU header)

=== Proprietary commands and URCs ===

* +CCTP: 1, "+49xxxxxxxx" indicates an outgoing call (on line 1?)

* +CLIN: 0 indicates an incoming call on line 0

* +CMSM: 3 means "SIM unlocked"; +CMSM: 0 means "SIM locked". If the SIM slot is empty, it will not appear at 
all after +CFUN=1 (before +ESCR)

* +EHOZ: 0,"" (homezone indication, homezone name)

* +ESATP: 81 (SIM Application Toolkit P?)

* +EMSR: 0 ?

* +ESMT: 1 ?

* +EFLEX: 99,FE ?

* +ESCR ? (Sim Card Ready?)

* See http://wiki.openezx.org/AT_commands -- we might add more commands here as well, if ogsmd is using them.
