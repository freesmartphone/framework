Lessons learned from the implementation of ogsmd 1.x

=== Things to change ===

* Per-command timeouts do not make sense; rather maintain a reasonable
  channel timeout (say 90 seconds or so) that gets reset on every incoming
  data. When we are actually waiting for an answer and it triggers,
  try to escalate resetting the parser and/or (transparently) relaunching
  the last command.
  
* Per-command retries _might_ make sense.

* Dragging an error callback around for every command does not make
  sense, if the error refers to channel errors (such as a timeout),
  as opposed to an actual command response error (which makes sense).
  
* If there's no reliable way to detect unsolicited responses (such as
  a physical or a virtual RING line) _and_ the modem does not
  guarantee delaying them between a request and a response, then
  the low level parser needs to be fed a list of valid prefixes for
  every command.
  
* It _might_ make sense to define every AT command as a struct, including:
  * a list of valid prefixes,
  * a regular expression that groups values into elements,
  * a mapping of values to types.
  This could reduce quite some boilerplate code.
