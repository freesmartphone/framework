== TI Calypso specific notes ==

=== Behaviour ===

* On channel init, we better send \x1a first -- just in case something crashed while we
  were inside a multiline request command

* +CFUN=1 resets previous +CPIN="abcd" (even with 2nd parameter?)

* +CFUN=1 always "succeeds" even if it answers with ERROR (SIM PIN Required)

* I always receive CME ERROR 32 on +COPS=? until CREG=1

* +CREG=%d influences both the unsolicited response as well as the solicited response code

* Phonebook indices start with 1 (not 0)

* If SIM PIN not given, SIM file reading commands (phonebook, messagebook, crm) deliver the slightly misleading
  * CMS error code 310 (=SIM NOT INSERTED), or (yes, that can happen as well, if the PHB is not ready yet)
  * OK (=empty response) :( Readyness of the PHB is available if CFUN=1 and SMS auth given

* If SMS phone number available in messagebook, address name will be automatically inserted

* +CIEV supports 'signal' and 'smsfull' and has to be explicitly enabled with:
  +CMER=2,0,0,1,0 and +CIND=5,1

* +CBM Cell broadcasts only appear on the channel that issued +CNMI the last time.

* %CBHZ=1 needs to be issued otherwise the Calypso will swallow everything but the first CB

* Cancelling certain commands (ATH for a start) will render a channel unusable. Calypso moves into
  a Error 512 state in that case. You will have to restart the modem once this happens.

* Shutting down an ongoing GPRS connection can take ages. Need to better interface with pppd here.
