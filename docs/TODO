== controller / general ==
* introduce dbus subsystem or dbus object inter-dependencies and honor the dependency graph on startup

== odeviced ==
* add more device-specific modules
* get more characteristics from the Display object

== oeventd ==
* put metadata for parser into actions, triggers, and filters, so
a) we no longer need to specify the factories in the parser one-by-one, and
b) they can be treated as plugins (just toss a new one into a directory and it will be found on next startup)

== ousaged ==

== ogsmd ==

* make dbus_object a singleton?
* multipart SMSes (SMS PDU mode) on the API level
* improve yield support
* make parsing more straightforward (and automated)
* add more regexps
* revamp parser to take a number of expected prefixes. This should lead to much more
  reliable detection of unsolicited responses
* port to vala
* ...

== opreferencesd ==

* Add support for tree keys (like : foo/spam)
* Add support for dictionaries
* in the test dir, add a profile configuration file, that defines the possible profiles
