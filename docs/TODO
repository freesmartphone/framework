== controller / general ==
* get rid of self.interface in every dbus object and solely rely on introspection
  Benefits: 1.) get rid of double bookkeeping 2.) one object can serve multiple interfaces anyways
* introduce dbus subsystem or dbus object inter-dependencies and honor the dependency graph on startup

== odeviced ==
* enhance main module interface for simple introspection
* add device specific modules
* how to deal with granularity?
* how to handle priorities, e.g. when a device specific module would
  offer the same object/interface as a generic module?

* get more characteristics from the Display object

General Question:
* How much can or should we rely on ophoned being the only one talking to the modem?
  If so, we can simplify a lot on keeping internal state instead of
  poking the modem every time.

TODOS:
* add CCLD inspection for generic modem call handling
* make dbus_object a singleton?
* multipart SMSes (SMS PDU mode)
* USSD
* COLP=1
* improve yield support
* make parsing more straightforward (and automated)
* add more regexps
* ...

== opreferencesd ==

* Add support for tree keys (like : foo/spam)
* Add support for dictionaries
* in the test dir, add a profile configuration file, that defines the possible profiles
