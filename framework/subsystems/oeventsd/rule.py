#        It is an action connected to its trigger and a trigger connected to it's action
#        This way we could handle the do and undo easily. Right now it is not clear when we actually

       A Rule consist of :
       - a trigger
       - a list of filters
       - a list of actions

       The way it works is the following :
       When the trigger is activated, and if all the filter match the signal emitted by the trigger,
       The all the actions `do` method will be called.

       The signal is passed in form of keywords arguments in the trigger and untrigger methods.
       
       An rule can also optionaly be untriggered. If a rule can be untriggered,
       then it will keep state of its current status (triggered or not) and will
       call the actions `undo` method if its condition is not meet or if its trigger
