* Fix FIXMEs
* Clean up all the old relics
* Support "connecting" backends
* optimized number normalization comparison
* add all the types to the comparison (i.e support not only strings)
* Do a lot of testing because everything may be broken
* Add default fields, atm there are none
* Change the query system so it won't cache anything (or at least only entry ids, depends on the speed it'll work)
* Change the list of default types "deserving a table" per backend and handle others better
* create tables/indexes specific per type
* optimize stuff
* Discuss breaking API? for instance Peer instead of Sender/Recipient etc
* Verify ALL signals work (only messages/calls) are important to check
* Write a convert DB script
* Drop Path, got an "approvement" from mickey, first use both Path and Id, and then only Id
* Don't allow adding reserved fields (i.e start with $ or _ or path) or using them
* Force fields to type (python type) atm means buggy phonelog, etc
* Add support for _at_least_one
