* Fix FIXMEs
* Clean up all the old relics
* Support "connecting" backends maybe using %DOMAIN, i.e %Contacts will be a field containing a dictionary with (list containing dicotinaries when needed?) the matching contact should find a way to say how to match
* optimize number normalization comparison
* Do a lot of testing because everything may be broken
* Change the query system so it won't cache anything (or at least only entry ids, depends on the speed it'll work)
* Change the list of default types "deserving a table" per backend and handle others better
* create tables/indexes specific per type
* Discuss breaking API? for instance Peer instead of Sender/Recipient etc
* Verify ALL signals work (only messages/calls) are important to check
* Fix the hardcoded path in the conversion script
* Drop Path, got an "approvement" from mickey, first use both Path and Id, and then only Id
* We don't allow to query system fields, but we should catch the exceptions that makes, Add log messages when doing that and when trying to add reserved field
* Don't let removing default must have fields
* Add a get_single_entry_single_field operation in db_handler that'll save us the loading of all the fields that we do now
