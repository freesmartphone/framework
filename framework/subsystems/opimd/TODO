* Fix FIXMEs
* Clean up all the old relics
* Support "connecting" backends maybe using %DOMAIN, i.e %Contacts will be a field containing a dictionary with (list containing dicotinaries when needed?) the matching contact should find a way to say how to match?
Or maybe %DOMAIN_field = true? and compare is by using %DOMAIN = compare_field. Probably best would be %DOMAIN = {} (i.e a dict with stuff)
* Change the query system so it won't cache anything (or at least only entry ids, depends on the speed it'll work)
* create tables/indexes specific per type
* Discuss breaking API? for instance Peer instead of Sender/Recipient etc
* Drop Path, got an "approvement" from mickey, first use both Path and Id, and then only Id
* We don't allow to query system fields, but we should catch the exceptions that makes, Add log messages when doing that and when trying to add reserved field
* Don't let removing default must have fields
* Add a get_single_entry_single_field operation in db_handler that'll save us the loading of all the fields that we do now
* Make queries save ids, not full entries
* Fix missing check_single_entry

## Must do before release:
* Make sure this is the wanted db structure: 
 - Change the list of default types "deserving a table" per backend and handle others better
* Make sure timestamp on messages is stored as int and not text


-- Notes 
* Fix Tagging

-- Tasks
* <dos1> and Tasks is Contacts + UnfinishedTasks support :P

-- Messages
* Verify Ack and Nack messages (and special handling) work
