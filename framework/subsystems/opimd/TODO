* Fix FIXMEs
* Clean up all the old relics
* Support "connecting" backends maybe using %DOMAIN, i.e %Contacts will be a field containing a dictionary with (list containing dicotinaries when needed?) the matching contact should find a way to say how to match?
Or maybe %DOMAIN_field = true? and compare is by using %DOMAIN = compare_field. Probably best would be %DOMAIN = {} (i.e a dict with stuff)
* Add calculated fields, either make it possible to request type and have a default "generator" for it, or make more complex stuff.
* Add <Field to query everything that's smaller than the field + Add >Field to query everything that's bigger than the field + etc
* Discuss breaking API? for instance Peer instead of Sender/Recipient etc
* Drop Path, got an "approvement" from mickey, first use both Path and Id, and then only Id
* Make queries save ids, not full entries
* Fix missing check_single_entry
* FSO handlers, add a timer to check again if the framework is even loaded (when opimd starts before the framework)

*** Change retrieve query to work on a couple of ids at a time

-- Notes 
* Fix Tagging

-- Tasks
* <dos1> and Tasks is Contacts + UnfinishedTasks support :P

-- Messages
* Verify Ack and Nack messages (and special handling) work
