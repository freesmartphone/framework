Near future:
* CopyTo, MoveTo (in entries and in queries)
* use dbus.ObjectPath("foo") and "o" dbus signature
* Initialized signal in source
* uninitialize SIM backend on GSM resource release
In mean-time:
* write documentation
After that:
* prelimiting and postlimiting
* sorting by multiple fields (_sortby:['Surname','Name'])
* quering by field type
* backends configuration, status
* finished inteligent queries (ContactDeleted, ContactUpdated)
* updating with SIM-Messages-FSO
* adding new fields to for example SIM entry (by merging)
Think about:
* vcard support in SIM-Messages-FSO
* RSS-Messages backend (handler)
* Google-Contacts backend
* Evolution backends
Finishing:
* faster merging and avoiding duplicates
* using backend engine to query instead of cache when possible
* more optimalization, fine-tuning etc.
* world domination!
