Near future:
* quering "Phone" should check also "Office phone"
* sorting
In mean-time:
* Initialized, GetInitialized
After that:
* finished inteligent queries (ContactDeleted, ConactUpdated)
* updating with SIM-Messages-FSO
* adding new fields to for example SIM entry (by merging)
* RSS-Messages backend (handler)
* Messages on GenericDomain
Think about:
* way for quering using all or multiple fields?
* more domains?
Finishing:
* faster merging and avoiding duplicates
* using backend engine to query instead of cache when possible
* world domination!
