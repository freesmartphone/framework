Near future:
* UnfinishedTasks
* disabling handlers
* Initialized signal in source
In mean-time:
* write documentation
After that:
* backends configuration, status
* sorting by multiple fields (_sortby:['Surname','Name'])
* finished inteligent queries (ContactDeleted, ContactUpdated)
* updating with SIM-Messages-FSO
* adding new fields to for example SIM entry (by merging)
Think about:
* RSS-Messages backend (handler)
* Google-Contacts backend
* Evolution backends
* should quering "Phone" check also "Office phone"? regexps in fields?
Finishing:
* faster merging and avoiding duplicates
* using backend engine to query instead of cache when possible
* more optimalization, fine-tuning etc.
* world domination!
