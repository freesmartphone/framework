    The Resource class is used for anything that need to know about who is
    using a given resource. The ousaged subsystem manage all the resources and keep
    track of how many clients are using them. When a resource is no longer used,
    its Disable method will be called by ousaged. The resource objet can then do
    whatever is needed. When a resource is disabled and a client need to use it,
    ousaged will call its Enable method.
    
    A resource also needs to be able to prepare for a system suspend, or resume
    Ousaged will call the Suspend and Resume methods of the resource before a
    system suspend and after a system wakeup.
    
    To define a new resource, a subsystem need to subclass this class,
